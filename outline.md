# Death with a Touch of Sea

- Beetle
  * Slow speed
  * High health
  * High attack damage and slow attack speed:
    + Has knife horns that they can impale henchmen with
      - Basic impale requires a charge, so player must run in the current direction without stopping or being able to steer to attack
      - Relatively quick lunging attack that drives enemies underground temporarily
      - Can eat dead enemies to regenerate his exoskeleton
  * Cannot assume shell but has limited natural camouflage and can hide in extremely small spaces other characters cannot access

## Mechanics
- Shells act as both armor and camouflage
- Shells act as armor by absorbing a certain amount of damage before breaking apart
- Shells act as camouflage by allowing the player to pull their limbs in and hide with it:
  * Camouflage should be environment specific
  * A cardboard box would be appropriate indoors, a rock would be appropriate outdoors, etc
- Shells come in different sizes
- Henchmen alert if a shell moves in their vision or a shell appears suddenly in their recent path
- Henchmen try to capture/kill you when they notice you so they can cook you and serve you as a delicacy in the enemy player's restaurant, Dead Lobster
- You win the round by killing the opposing shell creature that the henchmen work for and serve him in your restaurant Au Bon Pain
